 Member Database with the purpose of holding information on members of CSIET. 


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 There are a few goals that need to be met with this project


 - members need to be able to login and update their own information


 - security measures need to be taken to ensure that only students are able to input information. This prevents cyber attacks with querying etc.


 - Companies need to be able to login to this page and search for students that may be of interest to them, access must be revokable and controlled


 - CSIET branding needs to take a big role in the UI, UX will also need to be very polished and professional, lots of css going on here


 - There needs to be a landing page with information about CSIET, think contact info, mission statement, meeting times etc


 - There needs to be seperate login pages for students and companies, branding and marketing will be different for each of these use cases


 - the database should be kept clean, if we think 10 years out, we don't want people who are out of college to necessarily show up without having to search explicitly for them, like maybe a past members section that is seperate from current college students





We have split group into a few roles, not strictly enforced, but general responsibilites





Dejuan Carson & Michael Stewart - Frontend Design: implement React frontend with clear branding and ease of use


Matthew Larsen - Database Engineering: design schemas and ensure reliable data acesss with ease of use 


Bradley Alford - Backend Engineering: design routing for frontend access of database information


Michael Stewart - DevOps & Integration: setup database, vercel(or other) hosting, frontend and backend integration, update guidelines as the club sees fit. 


The plan is to have a rough draft in 4-6 weeks, though this project is not huge, we can make it very polished and fun to use, while building a real world application to be deployed at a large scale.
